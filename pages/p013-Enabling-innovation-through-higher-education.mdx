## 13. Enabling innovation through higher education

We hope our impact can extend further than the students who walk through our doors. Our students
represent a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of students who seek higher education around
the world every year. We cannot serve every student, nor will our model of education work for every
student. We can, however, promote progressive education and emphasis on student outcomes to our
peers.

This document is our first attempt to share our philosophy and pedagogy, a practice weâ€™ll continue
through publishing white papers, blog posts, and research. We hope our learnings can extend, be
adapted, and inspire more experiments within higher ed. We want to serve as a beacon of innovation,
constantly questioning the status quo and challenging the boundaries of what it means to be an
accredited institution.

Our impact will be more wholly realized if there soon exist more Product Universities, adaptations
of our model to radically different yet in-demand disciplines, and more models of higher ed that
look nothing like ours but are equally radical.

In addition to thought leadership, we plan to open source much of our content and software to better
enable others to implement our innovations. We also hope to partner with colleges and universities -
as we are with Dominican University of California - to provide a subset of our courses as a computer
science minor on their campus to equip them to prepare students for the 21st-century economy.
