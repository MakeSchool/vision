## 10. Long-term career coaching

A college degree is considered to be helpful throughout one’s career. Specifically, the general
education, the institution’s brand to attract employers, and the alumni network to discover
opportunities. However, in a rapidly changing economy where skills are increasingly valued over
network, institutions need to look to expand their career support during a student’s education and
throughout their lives.

At Make School, career support begins with coaching and mentorship. Students meet with their coach
twice monthly to discuss their long-term goals and are guided through an academic plan designed to
support their trajectory. We seek input from our industry partners to determine which courses to
recommend students based on their desired career path. Industry mentors regularly visit our campus
and give students feedback on projects and guidance on how to best leverage their time both inside
and outside the classroom.

Students are continuously evaluated by their coaches against our job readiness rubric, a summary of
their proficiency in theoretical foundations, applied knowledge, communication, and soft skills.
Once a student demonstrates sufficient progress, they activate our career services. Students
participate in workshops to practice job interviews, prepare their portfolio and resume, and
negotiate offers. Coaches actively manage a student’s search for internships and jobs, while also
facilitating introductions for students to companies that match their goals. Once students are
placed into internships and jobs, we check in with students to ensure their onboarding is smooth and
the environment is a strong fit for them. Students frequently enter jobs with substantially faster
ramp-up times than typical new grads, and often receive promotions within their first year of work.

We aim to further support alumni beyond their first job. Our professional network, coaches, and
mentors remain available to alumni as they apply for their second and third jobs. We frequently
advise alumni who are founding their own companies, and help introduce them into founder and
investor networks.

This year, we are beginning to experiment with providing evening courses and online content to
alumni who want to continue their education once in the workplace. In the longer term, we may
consider offering part-time certificate or degree programs designed specifically for alumni
interested in moving into different domains or accelerating their career trajectories. Opportunities
for lifelong learning are critical for sustained career success and should be the responsibility of
post-secondary institutions to provide.
