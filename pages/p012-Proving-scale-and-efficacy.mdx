## 12. Proving scale and efficacy

The early results of our experiment have so far supported our hypotheses. Our outcomes are on par
with top universities, our students are engaged and inspired in the classroom, our alumni are
excelling in the workforce, and we are creating upward mobility for a diverse student body.

The next phase of our experiment will be more challenging than the first. Over the course of the
next 5 years we are seeking answers to a series of questions:

- **Can we maintain quality?** As we expand our student body to that of a mid-size private
  university, we’ll face new challenges with our systems of student support, instructor hiring and
  training, and career support, among others. Ensuring our education is a deeply personal and
  personalized experience will grow harder with scale. We must thoughtfully design systems to help
  uphold our values and ensure strong outcomes as we scale to a larger urban campus in San
  Francisco, and perhaps new cities.

- **Can we achieve long-term fiscal sustainability?** With exception of a small handful of private
  universities with near billion dollar endowments, most universities face challenging financial
  predicaments. Non-profit funding can be impacted by macroeconomic cycles.

- **How will alumni careers develop?** Our education has proven to result in strong outcomes, with a
  near 6 figure average starting salary. Top students have also been selected to join highly
  exclusive teams at top companies and moved into management roles at fast-growing startups.
  Long-term career success usually depends more on communication skills, rigorous professional
  development, and risk-taking rather than technical skills and starting salary. We plan to
  continually support alumni careers to ensure their careers continue to develop in an accelerated
  fashion.

- **Can we prove efficacy?** Most research evaluating efficacy of top institutions has shown their
  success is largely around selection bias rather than quality of education. Our outcomes have
  proven to be on par with top institutions while drawing from a much broader socioeconomic range of
  students. We want to go deeper to prove efficacy, both for individual courses and for career
  outcomes. We’re looking to develop stronger evidence that the classes we teach truly meet our
  course level and program level objectives. We also plan to use doppelgänger studies to compare
  career of our students to those of similar profiles studying at other institutions.

- **Can we remain adaptive?** The challenges faced by universities today are primarily due to the
  difficulty of directing a large organization to reinvent itself to the needs of modern students
  and employers. Though our education is suitable for today’s environment, we must assume that it
  won’t be suitable for tomorrow’s. We should look to design systems that inspire innovation and
  allow our education and institution to adapt to the psychology of future generations and the
  skills relevant to the future economy. Our feedback loops with industry and our own students will
  be essential to ensuring our institution can keep up with large-scale economic and societal
  shifts.
