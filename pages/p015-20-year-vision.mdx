## 15. 20 year vision

Our hope for Make School in the long term is to inspire a movement beyond the confines and structure
of a specific mold of institution. At the core, Make School is about empowerment and belonging. A
community that attracts like-minded individuals and gives them the knowledge and agency to tackle
the biggest problems in the world.

The characteristics that constitute the largest companies in the world and the top universities in
the world have heavy overlap. They unite large numbers of talented individuals under a shared
purpose and leverage this potential energy to drive innovation and economic advancement. They create
cultural norms, suggest ethical frameworks, and promote creative activity.

We hope to expand our ecosystem of education and innovation through various structures: our college,
open source curriculum for high schools, powering courses at other universities, continuing
education for our alumni, professional development within organizations, startup incubation, and
more.

We hope our community embodies a progressive value set, challenges itâ€™s own beliefs, and strives to
uplift those around us. We seek to create equity and drive economic advancement globally. We hope
our community is continually inspired to make, and that together we can reach billions of lives.
