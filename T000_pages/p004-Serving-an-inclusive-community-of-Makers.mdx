## 4. Serving an inclusive community of Makers

Where our applicants come from

Democratizing access to top quality higher education and career pathways is a core focus of our
organization. We offer financial aid through Title IV (protected by EIBR). We seek to create new avenues of upward
mobility for underrepresented populations who are often adverse to traditional debt and unable to
spend 4 years out of the workforce. We hope models like ours can help address systemic inequality as
the economy evolves.

In order to achieve this, we designed our admissions process to consider criteria tangential to
traditional institutions and to serve as a coach rather than a gatekeeper. We do not ask for SAT
scores or GPA (which are heavily correlated to access to high-quality education), instead we seek
proxies to evaluate aptitude for computing and sustained work ethic. Students demonstrate these
traits through computing coursework (either in school or online) and evidence of complex projects,
volunteer work, or employment. Should a student lack suffcient evidence at the time of application,
we ask students to participate in our Ramp program where they work through an online course
supported by weekly group office hours. This allows motivated students to earn admission into our
college and levels the playing field for students who were not afforded mentorship and opportunity
through their secondary education.

Our admissions remains selective, but on a different axis than the criteria of traditional
institutions. Some of our students rank highly on both axisâ€™ and choose Make School over Ivy+
institutions. Others rank highly on our criteria and choose us over state schools or community
colleges. As a result, our student body is far more diverse than Ivy+ institutions with similar
outcomes. 60% of our students are from low to mid-income backgrounds (compared to 10-15% at Ivy+
institutions) while nearly half identify as underrepresented minority students (compared to 15-20%
at Ivy+ institutions). Institutional design (discussed in depth below) needs to be mindful in
supporting a diverse student body with an emphasis on coaching, mentorship, and support outside the
classroom.

The Make School ethos and vision has resonated not only with a socioeconomically diverse population,
but a geographically diverse population as well. Similar to Ivy+ brands, but in contrast to other
institutions, majority of our applicants are from out of state, with 40% from other countries. We're
building a global pipeline of students possessing the Maker ethos through value-driven marketing
initiatives. We provide free online courses, free curriculum for high school classes, and a low-cost
summer program to engage students in our model of education. Early signs point to the development of
a global brand appealing to iGen students who seek progressive education and are passionate about
creating impact through technology.
