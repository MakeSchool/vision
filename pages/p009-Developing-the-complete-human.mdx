## 9. Developing the complete human

Experiences outside the classroom are as vital to students’ development as the education inside it.
College is often the first time people live away from home, make lifelong friends of different
backgrounds, learn time management, challenge their viewpoints, and develop character. The
construction of university environments enable these learnings, though few institutions do so with
deep thought and intention. We see great opportunity to improve upon the existing model of human
development in hopes of developing our students into successful adults and engaged citizens. In the
near term, we are focused on the following areas:

- **Consent culture**: Issues around sexual harassment and assault are rampant across college
  campuses and the tech industry, and deeply important to fix to ensure gender equality. Cultural
  norms and media propagate an unhealthy culture around dating and sex, especially when involving
  substances. We hold a responsibility to our students to ensure a safe environment for all genders.
  We are approaching this through a combination of preventative education around these issues,
  endorsement of consent culture, and systems for reporting. We don’t feel Title IX regulations do a
  good enough job of preventing incidents or educating students. We plan to share educational
  content we develop to help other institutions reshape culture around consent.

- **Mental health**: Today’s youth are experiencing greater mental health challenges. These
  challenges often correlate with inconsistent or poor academic performance and are often
  stigmatized. We integrate workshops around mental health into our education aiming to reduce
  stigma and introduce toolsets to help students manage their psychology. Our coaching program helps
  identify and support students going through internal challenges. We offer heavily subsidized
  mental health and therapy consultations - which nearly one-third of our students take advantage
  of - in addition to escalation paths for severe issues

- **Character development**: We’ve deeply integrated character development into our education to
  better prepare students for their careers and broader lives. Students learn about professionalism,
  thoughtful communication, empathy, willpower, mindfulness and honesty. Students are encouraged to
  practice skills through interacting with their peers and the broader community. We hope to build a
  community where people share their stories, feel less alone, plan personal-growth actions and hold
  each other accountable.

- **Diversity, inclusion, and community**: Our students come from all around the US (soon all around
  the world) and from all walks of life. Ensuring a culture that promotes diversity and is inclusive
  of all backgrounds and ways of thinking is essential to building a creative and safe environment
  where students can grow. We establish cultural norms and emphasize these values during orientation
  and recurrently throughout the year. We help students understand their biases and emphasize the
  mission and values that unite us all.

- **Student life in an urban campus**: We’re building our campus to be integrated into San
  Francisco, a city in the midst of a modern renaissance. San Francisco has been leading both a
  software-driven economic revolution and a counter-culture driven social revolution over the past
  decades. The cities booming growth is not without challenges, rising inequality, exorbitant cost
  of living, and growing segregation. We feel such an environment - rather than a discrete campus -
  is ripe for learning how to be an engaged citizen. Students commute through the city from their
  dorms to our school, finding opportunities to engage with the surrounding community. Students have
  access to tech industry events, academic lectures, and arts & culture shows that take place every
  night across the city. Students will take classes on politics and ethics, helping them understand
  their place in a larger ecosystem. We plan to increase expectations for students to be civically
  engaged, through volunteer opportunities and by building software to help power civic initiatives
  run by city government and local organizations.
