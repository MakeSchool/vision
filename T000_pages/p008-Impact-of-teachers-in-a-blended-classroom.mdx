## 8. Impact of teachers in a blended classroom

The progressive education model creates great opportunities for technology to augment (rather than
replace) human-centric education. Gains from technology have proved limited over the past decades
through an efficacy focused lens, though technology has substantially changed how students consume
education. Technology, so far, has been used as an add-on to existing classroom experiences rather
than leveraged to rethink how education is delivered. Though video lectures - which students can
watch and rewatch at their own pace - are undoubtedly a large improvement, they still propagate a
largely ineffective educational format.

Technology will undoubtedly be essential in designing future models of education. The challenge lies
in leveraging a blend of technology and humans to scale high-quality education. Large lecture
halls - and now video lectures - have served as an effective way to scale mainstream education, but
progressive education requires teachers to do far more than delivering content. So how can we
effectively scale teachers?

We should start by examining what the role of a teacher is in progressive education. Being a teacher
requires nearly as broad of a skillset as being an entrepreneur. Teachers build content, manage
dozens of people, review documents, complete administrative tasks, and more. We categorized the key
aspects of an instructors job at Make School and found 16 categories:

**Building new curriculum**

**Iterating on existing curriculum**

**Constructing projects**

**Evaluating projects**

**One-to-many content delivery**

**One-to-one topic clarifications**

**One-to-one problem solving**

**One-to-one office hours**

**Goal setting and prioritization**

**Performance interventions\***

**Admin, scheduling and reporting**

**Misc tasks**

\* applies to learners who are speeding ahead as well as falling behind

This breakdown provides us with a better understanding of the challenges of scale. Aspects of this
role are rote (thus automate-able), others are standard across cohorts (thus centralize-able), while
a core subset is deeply human and personal. The human and personal elements are the teaching
equivalent of the “last mile”. While pure software driven education can drive 80% of the education,
the remaining 20% - which typically is the highest leverage learning - is immensely difficult for
software to solve. Thus teachers can act as that last mile support, investing their time in
one-to-one and high leverage interactions with students. We see 4 key categories that fit into the
last mile of our education:

1.  Iterating on curriculum to meet the needs of a specific class based on student feedback
2.  Clarifying understanding of topics in one-to-one settings
3.  Problem-solving support for students’ custom projects in one-to-one settings
4.  Performance interventions to uplift struggling students, or further challenge accelerated
    students

**Building new curriculum** **Dedicated curriculum team**

**Iterating on existing curriculum**

**Constructing projects** **Dedicated curriculum team**

**Evaluating projects** **Automate**

**One-to-many content delivery** **Deliver digitally**

**One-to-one topic clarifications**

**One-to-one problem solving**

**One-to-one office hours** **Leverage mentor network**

**Goal setting and prioritization** **Digital learner tools**

**Performance interventions**

**Admin, scheduling and reporting** **Automate**

**Misc tasks**

This model of education ensures a human-centric and deeply personal experience. The efficiency gains
from our technology infrastructure will be focused around project evaluation, administrative work,
and supplementing human coaching with a learner dashboard that helps contextualize current work and
priorities into a long-term goal oriented roadmap.

In addition to leveraging technology, building a robust teaching corps is essential to scaling
high-quality progressive education. We anticipate hiring a diverse group of curriculum architects
and developers, and instructors of varying experience levels. We’re investing greatly in teacher
training and professional development to support our teaching corps. This investment will help us
ensure excellence in hiring, developing, and retaining high-quality teaching talent.

Looking forward, we’ll continue to experiment with modern software and tools - such as interactive
learning environments - to further integrate technology as a cornerstone of the classroom
experience. We view blended learning as a classroom experience redesigned from the ground up, with
software and teachers respectively solving problems they are best suited for.
