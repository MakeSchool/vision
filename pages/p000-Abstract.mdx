## Abstract

Make School is redesigning higher education for the 21st century. Our emphasis is on ensuring
relevance of education for the modern economy and accessibility to students of all backgrounds.

We predict a sustainable and scalable model of college can be built upon the following pillars:

- Combining the liberal arts with computing education in a bachelor's granting program
- Providing relevant and engaging education through real-world projects
- Uniting students from a broad socioeconomic range who possess grit (as measured by non-traditional
  metrics) and a passion for impact and innovation
- Ensuring students are the core focus of the institution
- Systemically aligning incentives of the institution with students and providing downside
  protection via (EIBR) Extended Income Based Repayment

Make School is more than a college. It's an ideology, a movement, and a community. To our students,
Make School provides, above all else, empowerment and belonging.

Our institution is a non-profit focused on serving the following mission:

> “To create avenues of upward mobility for students of all backgrounds, empowering such students to
> contribute to society through science and technology innovation.”

Our new model of college has enrolled over 300 students, coming from all walks of life and all
corners of the globe. Majority of our students come from low to mid-income families, while nearly
half identify as underrepresented minority students. Our career outcomes are on par with elite
universities, giving us evidence that talent is, in fact, diverse and distributed.

This document is intended to share our vision, our pedagogy, and our learnings to educators,
policymakers, and students. We hope our experiment will inspire innovation throughout the higher
education landscape and accelerate the broader conscious capitalism movement.
