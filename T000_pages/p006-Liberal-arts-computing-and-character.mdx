## 6. Liberal arts, computing, and character

In order to accomplish our aims, we've designed our education on four cornerstones:

Liberal Arts: A broad-based education helps round out studentsâ€™ worldview and understand the
potential for impact and risks of technology in our rapidly changing society. Students navigate
conversations about gender, race, and ethics currently facing the tech industry. Students take
classes on writing, design, personal finance, and economics to help them develop into a successful
professional and engaged citizen.

Computer Science Theory: Foundations in computer science are critical to understanding how computing
has developed and what the future holds. Through classes on data structures, algorithms, machine
learning and artificial intelligence students build the critical thinking and creative
problem-solving skills necessary to adapt over a long career in the rapidly changing technology
industry. Students develop the ability to architect software to solve complex real-world problems.

Software Development: Practical experience in building and shipping real-world software, using
industry standard tools and collaboration techniques equips students to secure and succeed in their
first job upon graduation. Students choose a technical concentration between mobile and web
development and learn the modern languages and frameworks in demand with employers. Students enter
the workforce knowing how to communicate with stakeholders and design great products.

Character Development: Modern organizations expect people to bring their whole selves to work, so we
expect students to develop their whole self at school. Leaders are defined not by their intelligence
or skill, but by their grit, resilience, courage, empathy, candor and kindness. Students work to
build character through coaching, guest speakers, discussions and group projects designed to help
them understand and navigate personal development and relationships with others.
