## 11. Systemic encoding of principles

As we’ve spent more time speaking with leaders of higher ed institutions, we’ve noticed many of our
viewpoints feel far less radical than they did just a few years ago. The modern crop of university
presidents feels well tuned to the challenges facing higher education. The difficulty for them lies
in driving systemic change in their institutions to address these challenges.

Our uniqueness today is not in our vision of what a new model of higher education looks like, but in
our nimbleness, our ability to execute on our vision, and our opportunity to design an institution
on these principles from the ground up.

Principles of organizations are often threatened as organizations scale. The challenges arise when
two principles conflict, when new leaders join the organization, and when resources (both time and
money) are stretched thin.

To help address these challenges, we are aiming to build our organization with only two primary
principles. Secondary principles exist, though they are explicitly subordinate to the two primary
ones.

1.  Students first
2.  A principle is only a principle if there exists a system to enforce it

The first is self-evident, one would be hard pressed to find an institution that did not consider
this a key principle. Yet institutions regularly sacrifice this principle. The importance of the
second meta-principle is to ensure institutional values are upheld. Creating systems to ensure
values-driven decision making will help address the core threats to organizational principles that
occur with scale. Systems can implicitly prioritize values and provide decision making support to
overworked team members and new hires.

A few examples of systemic principles at Make School:

- **EIBR**: Offering downside protection for student debt in form of Extended Income Based Repayment
  directly ties Make School’s financial incentives to student success. Our institutional focus is
  forced on outcomes rather than inputs as better outcomes will lead to less money spent on EIBR.
  This incentive also drives us to hold a tight feedback loop with industry and ensure our education
  stays relevant to the needs of the 21st-century economy.

- **Student Satisfaction**: One of our key organizational metrics - which we use to define success
  of our leadership - is a measure of student satisfaction. Expecting leadership to report on this
  metric monthly ensures we collect monthly student feedback, swiftly address student concerns, and
  frequently iterate on our courses.

- **Compensation Equation**: We define faculty and staff salaries based on a consistent salary
  equation based on skill and effectiveness. The equation limits negotiations, ensures fair
  compensation across the organization, reduces competitiveness, and increases trust and
  transparency. It protects our values of equity and diversity as we give managers systemic way to
  avoid implicit bias and ensure equal pay across demographics.

We believe thoughtful design of the systems that power our institution is key to building a
values-driven organization and ensuring quality at scale. In designing these systems, we must build
integrated relationships between the (often disjoint) functions of academics, finances, operational
metrics, and digital tools. We need to allow new information and ideas to challenge and change
existing systems to enable innovation and experimentation. We must establish protocols to make risk
and failure acceptable, and allow graceful recovery. If designed well, these systems can help ensure
sustainability and relevance of our institution over hundreds of years.
