## 5. Aims of a Make School education

Designing an effective education requires making choices surrounding the aims and outcomes of the
education. Diversity of institutions is important to create pathways for students with differing
goals. The aims of our education directly map to the wants and needs of our 18-22 year old,
career-oriented, computing focused, maker minded student.

Through our education, we aim to empower our students to grow into leaders and innovators who shape
the future of society. We do so through creating a supportive community of like-minded peers,
coaching students to vision their future, connecting our students to mentors further along their
desired trajectories, and providing an education aligned with student goals.

We define 5 core aims of our education:

Agency: College is a critical time for students to develop into adults with agency of their lives in
both professional and personal contexts. Students learn to live on their own, take care of their
health, budget their finances, prioritize their work, manage their time, communicate effectively,
manage expectations, build habits, and take responsibility for their actions.

Citizenship: In addition to learning to take care of themselves, students develop character
necessary to take care of those around them. Students formalize their ethical frameworks, practice
empathy, understand privilege, respect diversity, reject bias, define consent, volunteer for their
community, engage in local politics, and defend the morals and values they believe in.

Employability: Students develop a computing focused skill set in demand in today's economy, enabling
to take care of their livelihoods and often provide for their families. They are provided
opportunities to apply this skill set to develop a strong portfolio, and experience working in teams
to develop the task management, communication, and professionalism necessary to succeed in a
collaborative workplace.

Foundational knowledge: We seek to equip students with a foundational toolset and knowledge base to
serve a long-term career. This combines soft skills - such as critical thinking, problem solving,
growth mindset - and hard skills - such as computational thinking, modeling, data analysis. Most
fundamental is for students to develop a curiosity to continue learning and developing their minds
throughout their lives.

Impact mindset: Effectively combining citizenship and foundational knowledge can unlock potential of
students to become forces for good in the world. Students are influenced to seek employers solving
problems facing today's society, and challenged to predict problems that will face tomorrow's world.
Students develop a broad knowledge base to understand multi-faceted issues, consider first
principles to identify solutions, and apply systems-level thinking to predict how solutions will
need to adapt to scale.
